# TDPnet Overview

TDPnet operates as a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, requiring a suite of tools and specialized roles for effective management. The TDPnet setting encompasses four levels of abstraction:

## 1. Infrastructure

At the infrastructure level, field engineers are tasked with hardware placement, including optic cables, wireless stations, and routers.

## 2. Network

Network engineers operate at this level, managing the number and precise locations of all routers. Responsibilities include configuring the fixed topology and the core software within the routers.

## 3. Operation

Network operators take charge of basic network operations at this stage.

## 4. Application

The highest level involves service provider (SP) developers and system engineers.

Each level demands specific tools and skills to efficiently manage a TDPnet network. Some of these tools include:

### 1. Infrastructure

- Common tools and skills for SDN infrastructure settings.
- External contractors may be required.

### 2. Network

- **Simbionet:** Used for simulating and planning networks.
- **Autonet:** Used to define the operations of every element in the network.

### 3. Operation

- **MoNet:** Utilized for monitoring, administration, and configuration of the network.

### 4. Application

Engineers at this level employ common software development tools, such as Visual Studio Code.
