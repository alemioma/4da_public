Echo Messaging System

Overview
The Echo Messaging System is a network-based communication system designed to handle custom messaging protocols. It uses Socket.IO for network communication and extends its functionalities to handle specific message types, particularly "echo" messages. This system is composed of several modules, each contributing to the overall messaging protocol.

Modules
1. Session (File: session.js)
Description
The Session class is responsible for establishing and managing network connections using Socket.IO. It sends messages to the network and responds accordingly.

Key Methods
connect(host): Connects to the specified host.
send(id, data): Sends data to a specified id using the socket.
signin(data), signoff(data): Handle sign-in and sign-off actions.
2. Message (File: message.js)
Description
The message module provides functionalities for creating and validating messages.

Functions
create(from, to, subject, detail): Creates a message with the specified parameters.
valid(message): Validates if the message has a defined 'from' field.
3. Prompt (File: prompt.js)
Description
The Prompt class extends Session and establishes rules for the messaging protocol, specifically handling echo messages.

Key Methods
onEcho(data): Virtual method to be implemented for handling echo events.
echo(to, data): Sends an echo message to a specified recipient.
4. Prompt Implementation (File: Implementation within README)
Description
This is an implementation of the Prompt class. It sets up behaviors like host address and peers to communicate with, utilizing the configuration settings.

Key Methods
onGranted(data): Initiates an echo message upon being granted access.
onEcho(data): Handles echo responses by logging details and sending new echo messages.
5. Configuration (File: config.js)
Description
This module contains configuration settings for the application, including host address, credentials, and peer addresses.

General Purpose
The Echo Messaging System is designed to facilitate a specific type of network communication characterized by echo messages. It is capable of connecting to a network host, sending and receiving customized messages, and specifically handling echo-type messages. The system validates messages, logs communication details, and maintains an ongoing interaction with designated peers. It is suitable for environments where custom message handling and specific communication protocols are required.
